# tic-tac-toe-game
Advanced front end project for Freecodecamp

This project started fine but almost devolved into hopelessness. I was able to create a functional 2 (human) player game
pretty quickly, but the AI really tested my limits. Initially I thought I could brute force my way through the AI moves,
but 1) that seemed like a ton of unnecessary work and 2) I wanted a more eloquent solution. I ultimately settled on a loop
that checked an array of moves against another array of possible win combos. This didn't quite work the way I wanted to so
I needed to add a couple if statements so it wasn't so easy to win then I decided to submit it. Originally I thought it was
necessary to create an unbeatable AI when this wasn't actually the case, so I spent hours upon hours reading about how to implement the 
minimax algorithm. However, I wasn't able to quite wrap my head around it enough to implement it. Once I make more progress I plan 
to revisit this project and update it using minimax. 

Things I used/learned:

- More about event bubbling
- Got more practice with functional programming, but not perfect by any means. This was the first project 
where I started to more clearly see the benefit of creating more functions for smaller tasks and passing them around.
- Thinking through game logic
- Lots of practice with loops and arrays

Things I need to work on:

- Psuedo coding my apps
- Not losing hope
- Getting comfortable with more layers of abstraction
- Get better at working with arrays and objects
