# tic-tac-toe-game
Advanced front end project for Freecodecamp

Things I used/learned:

- More about event bubbling
- Got more practice with functional programming, but not perfect by any means. This was the first project 
where I started to more clearly see the benefit of creating more functions for smaller tasks and passing them around.
- Thinking through game logic
- Lots of practice with loops and arrays

Things I need to work on:

- Psuedo coding my apps before I begin
- Not losing hope
- Getting comfortable with more layers of abstraction
- Get better at working with arrays and objects
- Implementing minimax algo
